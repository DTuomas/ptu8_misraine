parso==0.8.3		# Parso is a Python parser that supports error recovery and round-trip parsing for different Python versions (in multiple Python versions).
					# Parso is also able to list multiple syntax errors in your python file.
					# Parso has been battle-tested by jedi. It was pulled out of jedi to be useful for other projects as well.

# wcwidth==0.2.5	# Measures the displayed width of unicode strings in a terminal:
					# Problem Statement: The printable length of most strings are equal to the number of cells they occupy on the screen 1 charater : 1 cell.
					# However, there are categories of characters that occupy 2 cells (full-wide), and others that occupy 0 cells (zero-width).
					# Solution: POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 conforming systems provide wcwidth(3) and wcswidth(3) C functions of which this python moduleâ€™s functions precisely copy.
					# These functions return the number of cells a unicode string is expected to occupy.
